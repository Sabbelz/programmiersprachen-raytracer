/**
 * The position, direction, xAngle and yAngle are given.
 * To calculate the imageplane we assume, that the width of the imagepalne is 1 (S.33, Einf√ºhrung-Raytracer).
 * At first we take a closer look at the triangle wich is given by the width, and the xAngle.
 * 
 * The bisectic of the xAngle is our distance to the imageplane and the adjacent side of the triangle. Half the width is the opposide side.
 * Thus, we get the term:
 * 
 * tan(xAngle/2) = 0.5/d
 * 
 * Rearrange this term to calcualte d.
 * 
 * d = 0.5/(tan(xAngle/2))
 * 
 * Now we can take a closer look at the triangle given by the yAngle. The distance is given by the calcualtion above,
 * therefore we have to calulat the hight of the plane.
 * 
 * h = 2d*tan(yAngle/2)
